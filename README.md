# HTML and CSS Fundamentals - Lab

This lab is a sandbox where I practice what we have learned with HTML and CSS 
during the [Web Developer](https://laplateforme.io/cdpi-developpeur-web-et-web-mobile/) training at [La Plateforme_](https://laplateforme.io/).


The lab for this website is available online:

Pushing the `main` branch to this repository, automatically triggers a deployment to GitHub's web servers thanks to *GitHub Pages*.
